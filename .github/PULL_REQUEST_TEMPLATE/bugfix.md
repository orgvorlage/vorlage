## Bugfix Description

Write here what you did to fix the bug and explain why it is the correct
bugfix. A good method would be to list out what each commit does.

## Further Work

Write here further work that needs to be done. These can include a lot of
different things. Some of the examples are:

1. Changes in codebase to prevent future bugfixes.
2. Work needed to fix the bug more comprehensively.
3. Work to find out similar potential bugs in the codebase.
